The goal of this repository is to hold a few different automated Twitter bots using different APIs. One example would be leveraging MySportsFeed's [python wrapper library](https://github.com/MySportsFeeds/mysportsfeeds-python), and tweeting the daily game schedule of a specific league depending on the season. <br/>
